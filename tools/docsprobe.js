// WHY THIS EXISTS. That instruction was an instruction, not a check, and it had drifted a long
// way: 12 of 52 effects appeared in NEITHER document, and the README's own count still said
// "thirty-eight". So the map a reader uses to decide where a new effect belongs was missing a
// fifth of the territory, and the user-facing page did not mention Flying ribbons -- the only
// effect that rasterises geometry -- at all.
//
// Adding an effect is meant to be "append one descriptor". This is what makes the docs part of
// that, at the cost of one sentence per effect.
//
// It reads README.md and CLAUDE.md from the REPO, not the built page (they are not in it), and
// takes the effect list from the built file so it is checking what actually shipped.
