  //
  // The detector is *spectral flux*, not band energy: each tick it sums the
  // positive frame-to-frame increases of every FFT bin in the band. Flux fires on
  // an *attack*; energy merely tracks loudness, so with an energy detector a
  // sustained bass line keeps its own baseline high and masks the kick sitting on
  // top of it. Three further points matter:
  //   · magnitudes come from getFloatFrequencyData and are converted dB → linear.
  //     The byte spectrum is dB-compressed, so a "1.4× the average" test there is
  //     a ratio in log space — a real 6dB hit barely moves the number.
  //   · the analyser's own smoothingTimeConstant is 0: it is a low-pass across
  //     frames and smears the very transients we want (and adds ~2 frames of lag).
  //   · a beat is a *local maximum* of flux above an adaptive threshold (median of
  //     the last ~1s × FLUX_K), not the first frame over a line — so it lands on
  //     the hit rather than somewhere up its rising edge, and the threshold
  //     follows the mix instead of being an absolute level.
  //
  // Analysis runs on a fixed HOP_MS timer, NOT on requestAnimationFrame: beat
  // timing then no longer jitters with framerate (a 30fps frame is 33ms of slop,
  // and two beats inside one frame would collapse into one). Beats found between
  // frames are latched into `beatNow` and cleared by frame() once updateAnims()
  // has consumed them, so none are ever dropped.
