  // ---- TRANSITIONS: how one preset gives way to the next ---------------------
  // Scenes that retain heat (Fire / Fade ticked) already dissolve on their own —
  // setEffect leaves the old heat in place and it decays under the new scene. Scenes
  // with no feedback filter rewrite the buffer on their first frame by design, so they
  // used to cut hard. These cover that gap.
  //
  // Every one is a mode of the single FS_TRANS pass, run between the zoom and the glow
  // against glTex.prev — which holds the OUTGOING SCENE, STILL RUNNING. Both sides of a
  // blend are live: `prevStack` is the stack array installStack replaced, every item frozen
  // and therefore self-contained, re-rendered each frame by renderPrevScene into the second
  // half of the per-slot buffers. (It was a frozen still until 1.34.0, on the grounds that
  // two live scenes would need two copies of singleton state; the per-layer colour path had
  // since made that false.)
  //
  // `fits(a, b)` returns a *weight* for a switch from scene a to scene b — 0 means
  // "never pick me for this pair". Both sides are {dense, retains, palette} summaries,
  // so the choice costs nothing: no pixel readback, just the descriptors.
